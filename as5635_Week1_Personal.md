### About Me:

 My name is Anoushka Sandeep. Though it is a name of grace given to me my parents, I prefer to be called Nikki, as it is the actual 
 name of which my parents call me. I'm a creator by nature, an enthusiast who sees the glass half full, and a sentimental, loving sister who tries a bit too hard to make sure I can keep my loved ones happy. These three qualities are ones of which have also 
impacted my student life; I had initially been a freshman at a university closer to home, but ultimately decided to transfer to Drexel
to pursue a major I could thrive in. I had been directed onto the path of computer science at my previous university with encouragement 
 from my father, but after realizing that my primary career goal would be to design and bring color to the digital world, I decided 
 to take a leap and join Drexel as a dragon. And I will say -- though it hasn't been so long yet, I have great pride in being a part 
of this community. 

<p> <br>
I mentioned that I am a creator by nature -- creating art has been a part of my being for as long as I can remember -- drawing on the walls turned into painting on large sheets of paper in elementary school, which turned into designing murals for my high school. I have dabbled in various forms of media, including different mediums of painting, embroidery, digital art, ink paintings, sculpting, print-making, and editing. I want to ensure to myself that while art breathes life into me, I can transfer that energy into my work in the future and facilitate people in my community with their needs. I hope to expand my skills to inspire others orencourage people to take action through websites that I can help redesign.

Some say not to have your job be surrounded upon your hobbies. Though art is something that keeps me inspired and cheery enough to pump through the day, there are many other activities I like to indulge in. I love to go biking with friends, I love to cook meals with my family, and I love to grow and tend to my plants. I like to organize my room and do menial tasks. I like to have conversations with new people as if I've known them forever. I love mango ice cream and spicy seafood and fresh coconut water -- all of which are delicacies of the homeland of my heritage -- Kerala, India. Being someone who was raised in America by two parents who were raised in India has given me the best of both worlds, and their support is something that I'm extremely grateful for.  

<p> <br>

Regarding my vision for the future, where I see myself in ten years is working at an organization trying to contribute to a digital movement. Digital media during present day changes so rapidly that I will have to be adept at applying my skills in new ways so I could help guide people through more complex times. As a designer it's important to observe the past, present, *and* future to know how to help a group of users attain what needs to be completed and I hope to achieve just that.
