        <h4>  I am an aspiring UI/UX Designer currently studying at the Westphal School of Design at Drexel University. I've always had a fondness 
            for creating art -- going from drawing on my parents' walls at home to designing and painting murals for my local high school. Being able to impart my personal 
            designs to enhance the technology that people may use is my current goal -- and I believe that my curiosity for sociology and computers will be a great partner 
            to accomplish this.

        <h4> With the pockets of free time I get, one could find me drawing in my sketchbook, tending to my plants, or going out for a walk and exploring my campus. As I've found myself
            having to spend more time indoors in the past two years, I've reconnected with my love for watching history documentaries and creating dishes that put a modern twist on my Malabar Coast heritage.
